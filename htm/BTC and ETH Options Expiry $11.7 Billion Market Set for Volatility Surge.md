# BTC and ETH Options Expiry: $11.7 Billion Market Set for Volatility Surge

With a combined **notional value of $11.7 billion**, this expiry could trigger heightened volatility in the coming days.

### Deribit's Warning on Market Uncertainty

Deribit, the leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, has highlighted the risks associated with this expiry. According to their latest data, **$11.7 billion in BTC and ETH options** will expire this Friday â€“ a day that typically sees the largest open interest accumulation. Market participants face two choices: either close existing positions or roll them over to June contracts. This decision-making process often leads to intensified trading activity and price fluctuations.

## FAQs: Your Expiry Event Questions Answered

### What exactly happens during options expiry?

Options contracts settle at predetermined strike prices, forcing holders to either close positions or take physical delivery. This process creates artificial supply-demand imbalances that can dramatically affect market prices.

### Why does the $11.7 billion figure matter?

This represents the total value of contracts expiring within 72 hours. Larger notional values typically correlate with increased volatility as market makers adjust hedging positions.

### How can retail traders prepare?

- Avoid leveraged positions during expiry window
- Monitor order book dynamics
- Set wider stop-loss parameters
- Consider volatility arbitrage opportunities

### Is this event bullish or bearish for crypto?

The impact depends on where price settles relative to major strike prices. A BTC close above $63,500 would favor bulls, while ETH needs to sustain above $3,200 for positive momentum.

## Technical Analysis: Key Levels to Watch

BTC traders should monitor:
- **Immediate support**: $61,200 (20-day EMA)
- **Critical resistance**: $64,800 (April high)
- **Volatility trigger**: $60,000 psychological level

ETH investors should focus on:
- **Pivot zone**: $2,950-$3,000
- **Upper boundary**: $3,300 (Q1 resistance)
- **Breakdown threshold**: $2,700 (March low)

## Strategic Implications for Q2 2025

This expiry event could set the tone for the remainder of Q2. Analysts suggest three possible scenarios:
1. **Bullish breakout**: $11.7 billion expiry drives momentum toward all-time highs
2. **Range-bound consolidation**: Market remains sideways before June quarterly expiry
3. **Volatility compression**: Decreased volatility following expiry event
