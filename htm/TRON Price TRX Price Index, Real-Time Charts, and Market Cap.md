# TRON Price | TRX Price Index, Real-Time Charts, and Market Cap  

## TRON Blockchain Overview  
TRON (TRX) is a blockchain platform founded in 2014 by Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun. Designed to revolutionize the media and content creation industry, TRON empowers creators to maintain ownership of their work while receiving direct rewards from consumers. Unlike traditional platforms requiring creators to surrender rights to intermediaries, TRONâ€™s decentralized infrastructure eliminates middlemen, enabling peer-to-peer interactions and monetization.  

### Key Features of TRON  
- **Zero Transaction Fees**: The TRON blockchain operates without charging fees for network usage, making it accessible for developers and users.  
- **High Throughput**: Supporting up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), TRON prioritizes scalability for real-world adoption.  
- **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Consensus**: This mechanism secures the network through 27 elected "Super Nodes," which rotate every six hours to prevent collusion.

## TRX Token and Its Role  
TRX is the native cryptocurrency of the TRON blockchain, serving two primary functions:  
1. **Rewarding Creators**: Consumers use TRX to directly compensate content creators on the platform.  
2. **Network Governance**: TRX holders vote for Super Nodes and influence protocol upgrades.  

### Migration from Ethereum to TRC-20  
Initially launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, TRX transitioned to TRONâ€™s proprietary TRC-20 standard in 2018. This shift reduced dependency on Ethereumâ€™s network congestion and fees. Users must now utilize TRC-20-compatible wallets like **TronLink** or **imToken** for secure storage and interaction with the TRON ecosystem.  

## Economic Model and Supply  
TRX has a maximum supply cap slightly exceeding 100 billion tokens, with 71.6 billion currently in circulation. The remaining 28.4 billion will be gradually released through block rewards and network activities.  

### Key Economic Metrics  
| Metric                | Value                     |  
|-----------------------|---------------------------|  
| Max Supply            | 100.2 billion TRX         |  
| Circulating Supply    | 71.6 billion TRX (2024)   |  
| Market Cap            | ~$5.75 billion            |  
| Block Reward          | 32 TRX per block          |  

TRX incorporates deflationary mechanisms through token burns and staking rewards, ensuring long-term value retention. Unlike Bitcoinâ€™s fixed supply, TRONâ€™s model allows dynamic adjustments to align with network growth.
