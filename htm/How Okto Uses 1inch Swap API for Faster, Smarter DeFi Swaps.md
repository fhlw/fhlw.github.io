# How Okto Uses 1inch Swap API for Faster, Smarter DeFi Swaps

The integration of **1inch Swap API** has revolutionized the DeFi experience for **Okto**, the first live chain-abstracted wallet, by enabling seamless token swaps across EVM-compatible networks. This collaboration addresses critical pain points in decentralized finance, including fragmented liquidity, high transaction costs, and complex user workflows. By leveraging 1inch's advanced liquidity aggregation and routing technology, Okto delivers faster, more reliable, and cost-effective trading solutions for its users.

This article explores the technical and strategic benefits of this integration, its impact on user experience, and the future of cross-chain interoperability in DeFi.

## Okto: Simplifying Web3 Access

Okto's mission, "Experience Web3, The Easy Way," drives its development as the first live chain-abstracted wallet. It abstracts the complexities of blockchain mechanics while maintaining the security of self-custody. However, prior to integrating 1inch, Okto faced significant challenges in the DeFi landscape:

- **Fragmented liquidity**: Users had to navigate multiple platforms and wallets to access optimal trading opportunities.
- **Complex transaction workflows**: Manual chain selection, gas fee management, and cross-chain bridging created friction, especially for newcomers.
- **Limited scalability**: Supporting a growing number of chains and tokens required a robust technical solution.

These challenges prompted Okto to seek a partner capable of providing deep liquidity, intelligent routing, and reliable infrastructure.

## Initial Challenges

Okto prioritized optimizing three key metrics to enhance user satisfaction:

1. **Speed**: Ensuring rapid transaction execution.
2. **Reliability**: Maintaining consistent access to liquidity.
3. **Cost**: Minimizing fees and slippage.

The fragmented nature of DeFi made these goals difficult to achieve independently. Slow transaction speeds on congested networks eroded user trust, while the lack of a unified interface for liquidity aggregation left traders navigating a disjointed ecosystem. Okto needed a solution that could abstract these complexities and deliver seamless swap experiences.

## Why Okto Chose 1inch

After evaluating competitors like Uniswap, Li.Fi, and Socket, Okto selected 1inch for its superior capabilities in three areas:

### Superior Liquidity Aggregation

1inch integrates over 100 decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and liquidity pools across EVM-compatible chains. This extensive coverage ensures access to rare token pairs and deep liquidity, enabling Okto to support a broader range of trading scenarios. Rohit Jain, Head of Okto, emphasized, "1inch has integrated the most number of DEXes at their end... liquidity would be the highest on this naturally."

### Advanced Routing Technology

The **Pathfinder algorithm** developed by 1inch identifies optimal swap routes by splitting transactions across multiple liquidity sources. For example, when swapping SHIB to BONK on the same chain, 1inch might route through intermediate tokens like USDC to achieve the best rate. This dynamic routing ensures efficiency even when direct pools are unavailable.

### Performance and Reliability

1inch consistently delivers faster execution than alternatives, a critical factor in volatile markets. Its infrastructure remains resilient during high-demand periods, ensuring consistent performance for Okto's growing user base.

## Technical Integration of 1inch Swap API

Okto implemented 1inch Swap API across its platform to power 76-80% of its total swap volume. Key integration points include:

### Same-Chain EVM Swaps

Okto exclusively uses 1inch Swap API for same-chain swaps on EVM-compatible networks. This integration handles the majority of transactions, providing users with competitive rates and minimal slippage.

### Cross-Chain Bridging Support

Okto employs an "inline bridge" approach for cross-chain swaps:

1. **Convert the source token to a stablecoin** (e.g., USDT) on the origin chain via 1inch.
2. **Bridge the stablecoin** to the destination chain using Okto's infrastructure.
3. **Convert the stablecoin to the target token** on the destination chain via 1inch.

For instance, swapping SHIB on BSC to BONK on Base involves three steps: SHIB â†’ USDT (BSC), USDT bridge to Base, and USDT â†’ BONK (Base). This method ensures liquidity availability across chains.

### Technical Implementation

The integration was streamlined by 1inch's comprehensive documentation and API structure. Customizations include:

- **Slippage management**: 1inch honors Okto's slippage tolerance settings.
- **Real-time quotes**: Accurate price and gas estimations.
- **Routing abstraction**: Complex logic is handled by 1inch, simplifying the user experience.

## Benefits and Outcomes

The 1inch integration has delivered measurable benefits for Okto and its users:

### Enhanced User Experience

Users gain access to deep liquidity and competitive rates without needing to understand blockchain mechanics. Swaps are executed seamlessly, abstracting the complexity of DeFi.

### Expanded Trading Capabilities

Okto now supports rare token pairs and a wider range of assets, aligning with its mission to democratize DeFi access.

### Technical Efficiency

Okto's development team reduced overhead by leveraging 1inch's infrastructure:

- **Reduced development costs**: Avoided building proprietary routing algorithms.
- **Standardized APIs**: Simplified maintenance and updates.
- **Reliable performance**: 1inch's infrastructure ensures uptime even during high volatility.

### Performance Metrics

| Metric                | Before 1inch | After 1inch |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Average Swap Speed    | 15 seconds   | 6 seconds   |
| Slippage Reduction    | 1.2%         | 0.5%        |
| Supported Token Pairs | 500          | 2,500       |

These improvements directly address Okto's initial challenges, enhancing speed, reliability, and cost-efficiency.

## Future Collaboration: Okto Chain and Beyond

With the anticipated launch of **Okto Chain**, the partnership with 1inch is set to evolve. Plans include leveraging 1inch technology on both sides of cross-chain transactions for even smoother interoperability. This collaboration exemplifies how specialized protocols can address DeFi fragmentation, driving mainstream adoption through accessibility and efficiency.
