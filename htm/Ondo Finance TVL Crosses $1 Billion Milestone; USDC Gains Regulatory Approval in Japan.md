# Ondo Finance TVL Crosses $1 Billion Milestone; USDC Gains Regulatory Approval in Japan  

## Market Overview  

The crypto market experienced mixed momentum this week, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) showing positive price movements. Key developments include:  

- **BTC** rises 4.32% to $87,733.4  
- **ETH** gains 5.35% to $2,182.01  
- **Ondo Finance TVL** surpasses $1 billion  
- **Morph Protocol TVL** exceeds $20 million  
- **Solana network fees** drop to $1.16 million  
- **USDC** becomes Japanâ€™s first approved dollar stablecoin  
- Bitcoin mining sector faces 22% valuation decline  

## Price Analysis  

### Bitcoin (BTC)  
BTCâ€™s price chart reveals a consolidation phase within the $86,000â€“$88,000 range. After finding support at $81,500 and encountering resistance near $88,900, the asset exhibits sideways movement. Technical indicators show overlapping moving averages, suggesting indecision in market direction. While short-term stability persists, sustained upside momentum requires stronger volume participation.  

### Ethereum (ETH)  
ETH maintains a bearish trend but shows tentative signs of recovery. Following a bounce from $2,000, the MACD indicator generates a bullish signal through expanding green histograms. However, weak trading volumes indicate insufficient conviction for a breakout. Investors should monitor $2,200 as a critical resistance level for potential trend reversal.  

### ETF and Macro Context  
March 4 saw $80.89 million net outflow from US Bitcoin spot ETFs, contrasting with $19.18 million inflow for Ethereum equivalents. Global equities declined, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.22% and the Nasdaq falling 0.35%. The Fear & Greed Index at 20 reflects extreme market pessimism, aligning with current consolidation patterns.

### Morph Protocolâ€™s Explosive Growth  
Morph Protocolâ€™s TVL surged from $5 million to $21.88 million within weeks, driven by its consumer-focused Layer2 strategy. Notable features include:  

| Component        | Description                          | Impact                     |  
|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|  
| BulbaSwap        | $25M+ monthly trading volume         | Liquidity attraction       |  
| bAI Fund         | First AI-driven DeFi fund            | Innovation differentiation |

This growth trajectory highlights Morphâ€™s potential as a bridge between DeFi and mainstream adoption through practical applications.  

## Network Performance Analysis  

### Solana Fee Dynamics  
Solanaâ€™s fee structure demonstrates extreme volatility, peaking at $35.53 million in January 2025 before collapsing 96.7% to $1.16 million. Key insights:  

- **Meme Coin Impact**: Previous high fees correlated with speculative trading frenzy  
- **Infrastructure Resilience**: Network hash rate maintained 3% growth to 810 EH/s despite declining revenues  
- **Future Catalysts**: Potential fee recovery through upcoming dApp launches or renewed market speculation  

The sharp decline underscores the sectorâ€™s sensitivity to short-term hype cycles.  

## Regulatory Milestones  

### USDC Breakthrough in Japan  
Circleâ€™s USDC becomes Japanâ€™s first legally sanctioned dollar stablecoin through SBI VC Tradeâ€™s EPP license. Strategic implications:  

- **Regulatory Precedent**: Establishes framework for stablecoin adoption in Asiaâ€™s third-largest economy  
- **Partnership Timeline**:  
  1. 2023: SBI-Circle collaboration announcement  
  2. March 2025: Planned USDC service launch  
- **Market Expansion**: Positions USDC for institutional adoption in Japanese DeFi and cross-border payments  

This regulatory approval marks a pivotal step toward crypto-fiat integration in traditional financial systems.  

## Industry Challenges  

### Bitcoin Mining Sector Struggles  
14 publicly traded mining firms collectively lost 22% market value in February 2025:  

| Metric                | Value          | YoY Change |  
|-----------------------|----------------|------------|  
| Block reward income   | $54,300/EH/s   | -5%        |  
| Gross profit          | $29,500/EH/s   | -9%        |  
| Network hash rate     | 810 EH/s       | +3%        |  

Key stress factors:  
- BTC price weakness limiting liquidity options  
- Energy cost inflation (e.g., North American natural gas prices)  
- Legacy hardware inefficiencies in competitive mining environments  

The sector faces existential pressure until mining difficulty adjusts to current economic realities.  

## Policy Developments  

### White House Opposes DeFi Reporting Rules  
The administrationâ€™s reversal on IRS broker reporting rules signals regulatory relief for decentralized finance:  

- **S.J. Res. 3 Support**: Repeals requirements for DeFi protocols to report user gains  
- **Industry Impact**: Provides 12â€“18 month compliance buffer for protocol developers  
- **Political Context**: Reflects shifting crypto policy stance ahead of key state elections  

While offering short-term reprieve, long-term SEC actions through securities classification remain a regulatory threat.  

## Investment Trends  

### Notable Fundraisings  
Top three recent crypto investments:  

1. **Flowdesk** â€“ $102M (Market making expansion)  
2. **Metaplanet** â€“ $87M (Bitcoin reserve accumulation)  
3. **Across Protocol** â€“ $41M (Intent-driven cross-chain infrastructure)
