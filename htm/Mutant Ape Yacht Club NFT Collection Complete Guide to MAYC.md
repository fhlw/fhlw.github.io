## Understanding the MAYC Ecosystem  

### What Is the Mutant Ape Yacht Club?  
MAYC was designed to reward BAYC holders and expand the community. By combining elements of BAYC with new mutations, Yuga Labs created a bridge between existing and new NFT enthusiasts. The projectâ€™s roadmap emphasized inclusivity and innovation, setting the stage for future developments like the Otherside metaverse.  

> **Pro Tip**: MAYC holders gain exclusive access to Yuga Labsâ€™ ecosystem, including airdrops of the $APE token.  

### How Do Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs Work?  
There are two pathways to acquire a MAYC NFT:  
1. **Mutate Your BAYC**: Inject your Bored Ape with a mutant serum.  
2. **Public Minting**: Claim one of the 10,000 publicly available NFTs.  

#### Serum Mechanics  
- **M1 Serum**: Common (7,500 distributed)  
- **M2 Serum**: Uncommon (2,492 distributed)  
- **M3 Serum**: Rare (8 distributed)  

Applying a serum transforms your BAYC into a Mutant Ape while preserving the original NFT. Visual mutations include dripping skin, bulging eyes, and distorted features, adding uniqueness to each piece.  

| Serum Type | Quantity Distributed | Scarcity Level |  
|------------|----------------------|----------------|  
| M1         | 7,500                | Common         |  
| M2         | 2,492                | Uncommon       |  
| M3         | 8                    | Rare           |

## Minting Process and Market Availability  

### How to Mint MAYC NFTs (Historical Context)  
The initial minting phase occurred via a Dutch auction on August 28, 2021. Prices started at 3 ETH and dropped to 0.01 ETH until the collection sold out in under an hour. Yuga Labs implemented a "stealth drop" to prevent bot exploitation, ensuring fair distribution.  

### Current Acquisition Methods  
MAYC NFTs are no longer mintable but available on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea. To purchase:  
1. Fund an Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask).  
2. Navigate to the [MAYC collection on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club).  
3. Complete the transaction using ETH.

## Behind the Scenes: Who Created MAYC?  
Yuga Labs, the team behind BAYC, developed MAYC. The original four membersâ€”Gordon Goner (Wylie Aronow), Gargamel (Greg Solano), No Sass (Zeshan Ali), and Emperor Tomato Ketchup (Karem Atalay)â€”remained anonymous until early 2022. Their technical expertise and creative vision solidified MAYCâ€™s position as a blue-chip NFT collection.
