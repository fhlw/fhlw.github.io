# My Phone Isn't Working, What Should I Do?  

Mobile phone access issues can disrupt critical account verification processes, especially for platforms like OKX that prioritize security. Whether you're experiencing SMS code failures, need to change your phone number, or require urgent account recovery assistance, this guide provides actionable solutions.  

## Troubleshooting SMS Code Issues on OKX  

If you're unable to receive or use SMS verification codes for your OKX account, follow these structured solutions:  

### Step 1: Synchronize Device Time Settings  
Time discrepancies between your device and the server can invalidate SMS codes. Ensure automatic time synchronization:  

- **Android**:  
  `Settings > General Management > Date and Time > Enable "Automatic date and time"`  

- **iOS**:  
  `Settings > General > Date & Time > Toggle on "Set Automatically"`  

### Step 2: Clear App and Browser Cache  
Cached data corruption often causes verification failures:  

- **Mobile App**: Clear cache via `Settings > Apps > OKX > Storage > Clear Cache`  
- **Desktop Browser**: Delete cookies and cached files through browser settings  

### Step 3: Cross-Platform Code Entry Testing  
Try entering codes on different platforms to isolate technical issues:  

| Platform                | Action                                 |  
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|  
| Desktop Browser         | Visit [OKX website](https://bit.ly/okx-bonus) directly |  
| Mobile Browser          | Access OKX mobile site via Chrome/Safari |  
| Desktop App             | Use OKX desktop application              |  
| Mobile App              | Open OKX mobile application              |  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: After changing or unlinking your phone number, fund withdrawals are restricted for 24 hours to prevent unauthorized access.  

## Changing Your Phone Number on OKX

### Verification Method Alternatives  
Even with mobile verification enabled, you can log in using alternative methods:  

1. **Mobile App**:  
   - Select **"Switch verification method"** during login  
   - Options include email code, authenticator app, or voice call  

2. **Web Platform**:  
   - Click **"Call me instead"** on the login page  
   - Receive verification via voice call or email  

### Step-by-Step Number Change  
1. Log into your OKX account using alternative verification  
2. Navigate to **Account Settings > Security > Phone Number**  
3. Follow prompts to verify ownership of the new number  

## Resetting Your Phone Number  

Complete phone number removal requires account verification:  

1. Access **Security Settings** on OKX
